# Block disappearing fix mod (forge)

This is a rework of the https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/block-limit-fix mod by TropheusJay
to allow it correctly run for 1.19.2

This mod fixes a serious issue in Minecraft for large modpacks - https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-258163.
It causes disappearing or corrupting blocks upon user/world interactions for blocks with higher ID numbers,
after which user relogin or teleporting away and back displays all blocks correctly.

Tested for forge only, though project allows Fabric build (need to finalize Fabric part).
